This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7.

## Development server

Run npm install at first then, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Techniques
All the functionality implemented in the frontend, the database generated by the json file and the request to it sent using the asynch loading methods from the rxjs library. Localstorage is used to save user actions, and display a list of your favorite movies.

## Working principles

On the main page there is a list of movies, where there is a button 'add', when you click on it, this movie is added to the cart(favorite list of Movies) , where you can then delete it and by clicking on the cart you can see what is there.
